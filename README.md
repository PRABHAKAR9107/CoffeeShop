<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot](./images/pt.png)

Coffee Shop Landing Page is a clean, minimal, simple but modern template designed in Sketch, made especially for coffee shop.Landing pages with big images.

A classic cafe website layout might include sections like “our coffee shops”, “coffee products” or “customer testimonials”. Here are some coffee shop websites that utilize this simple user interface to help visitors find the relevant information quickly.
